- mix

in a bowl: 
- 1.5 cup flour
- 1/4 tsp salt

Knead dough by hand until smooth

Cover and let rest for 1 hours. 

Knead for another minute.

Roll into a thin layer. Cut shapes with tiny holes (to let out air)

> [!TIP]
The thinner you make the pieces, the more crunchy they'll be (which is the goal)

Brush surface with oil + water

Sprinkle salt on top

Place in oiled pan into the oven at 180C preheated oven for 10-20 minutes (check on them every now and then, till they tan nicely)
