> [!NOTE]
The firmer you press together, the better the bars will hold up. Wet your hands and press with your palm, or use the back of a cup.

> [!NOTE]
Make sure the liquids and the dry ingredients are all incorporated together that they form a big lump. This also ensures that you  get perfect firm bars eventually.

> [!NOTE]
If you want toasted crunchy bites, stir from time to time in the oven.

If refrigerating, leave for 4-5 hours.
